            <h4>Graphic & Web Design co-op - DSBIA</h4>
            <h2>Where Design Meets Community Action.</h2>
            <p>In Summer 2024, I joined the Downtown Surrey Business Improvement Association (DSBIA) as the sole 
                Graphic and Web Designer on a multidisciplinary student team. While others specialized in community
                 engagement, social media, safety, and event planning, I was responsible for the design and production
                  of nearly all visual materials—from large-scale guidebooks to websites and branding support for 
                  small businesses.</p>

            <h4>Guidebooks</h4>
            <h5>Restaurant Guide 2024</h5>
            <p>One of my first and favourite projects was designing the BIA’s annual Restaurant Guide. Working 
                closely with our content lead, I ensured all restaurant listings were accurate and visually engaging. 
                The layout evolved over the course of the summer as I fine-tuned spacing, colour, and hierarchy for 
                readability.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>Care Companion 2024 (Medical Guide)</h5>
            <p>I also created the BIA’s first-ever medical guide, the Care Companion, in collaboration with colleagues
                 who sourced all the business data. On our final print deadline, I encountered a serious file 
                 corruption issue. I ended up rebuilding the entire project in InDesign—in under 3 hours. It was
                  stressful, but it taught me how to stay calm under pressure and prioritize key layout decisions
                   on a tight timeline.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>ACM Accessibility Pamphlet</h5>
            <p>Making civic participation more accessible was an especially meaningful part of my role. I designed 
                a pamphlet for All-Candidates Meetings to help all community members engage in the democratic process.</p>

            <h4>Event Design</h4>

            <h5>Movies Under the Stars</h5>
            <p>For the BIA’s biggest event of the year, Movie Under the Stars, I developed a full suite of promotional
                 materials to generate excitement and inform the community. This included large-format vinyl posters 
                 for outdoor visibility, printed handouts to distribute at local events, and a campaign ad that ran 
                 in the Surrey Now-Leader newspaper. Each piece was designed to reflect the friendly and welcoming 
                 tone of the event while staying true to the BIA’s branding.</p>

            <h5>Downtown Surrey Fest</h5>
            <p>For Surrey Fest, I created a diverse range of assets to support both promotion and day-of logistics. 
                These included A4-sized flyers posted in community hubs like libraries and local businesses, large 
                signage displaying the event schedule and sponsor recognition, and bright digital ads featured on 
                screen displays inside the mall. A print advertisement also ran in the Surrey Now-Leader, tying the 
                whole campaign together with consistent design.</p>
            
            <h5>Community Events</h5>
            <p>I also designed promotional materials for smaller community-focused events, including a flyer for 
                the Stamp Hunt and one for the Grosvenor Road Greenspace Meet-Up. The goal was to bring residents 
                together and create a stronger sense of place.</p>
            <p>The Stamp Hunt flyer encouraged locals to visit participating businesses, complete mini-challenges, 
                and collect stamps for a chance to win prizes. It was designed to be fun, approachable, and easy to 
                follow. The stamp book I made for this was one of the most creative and fun things I designed that
                 summer.</p>
            <p>The Greenspace Meet-Up flyer invited people to share their ideas for revitalizing the area. The event
                 featured pizza, games, and community feedback boards. My flyer helped communicate a sense of warmth,
                  playfulness, and local care—key to getting neighbors involved in shaping the future of this shared
                   space.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Local Businesses</h4>
            <h5>Umami Ramen</h5>
            <p>For a ramen restaurant, I designed a cohesive set of branded materials, including loyalty cards, 
                small acrylic table signs for in-store promotion, and a series of social media graphics. These
                 assets helped establish a more consistent and professional identity across both physical and 
                 digital spaces.</p>
            
            <h5>Raunak Indian Cuisine</h5>
            <p>I also worked with an restaurant called Raunak Indian Cuisine. The restaurant’s website was hosted on 
                WordPress, where I made targeted updates to improve both visual consistency and readability across 
                pages. This included refining the typography, spacing, and color palette to align more closely with 
                the restaurant’s existing brand.</p>
            
            <h5>David Pel Accounting</h5>
            <p>I conducted a branding survey to help an accounting firm reimagine its identity for a future rebrand.
                 Survey insights showed a preference for cooler blue tones, aligning with industry standards and 
                 their desired attributes (e.g., trust, professionalism).</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>

            <p>My summer at the DSBIA was one of the most rewarding experiences of my design journey so far. Being 
                the only designer on a large team pushed me to take initiative, communicate clearly, and manage 
                multiple deliverables across print and digital. I learned how to work independently, but also how 
                to collaborate effectively within a team. I left the internship more confident in my skills—and excited
                 for what’s next.</p>
