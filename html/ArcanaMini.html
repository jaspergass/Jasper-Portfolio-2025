                <h4>Arcana Mini</h4>
                <h2>A calming digital companion for tarot reflection.</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Arcana Mini is a mobile app concept designed to complement a reader’s personal tarot deck,
                 allowing users to look up card meanings and journal their spreads. I originally developed 
                 the idea and created an Android prototype for a class project in 2023. Later, I had the opportunity
                  to reimagine the experience through Surge, our campus developer club, where I led a team of four 
                  first-time React Native developers.</p>
            <p>As the project lead, I was responsible for the concept, UX/UI design, prototyping, and team coordination.
                 Although we faced technical challenges and were unable to complete the app in React Native, I 
                 delivered a fully interactive prototype in Figma that brought the vision to life and guided 
                 future development.</p>

            <h4>Design Process</h4>
            <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
            <p>A key part of the planning process was mapping out the app’s structure and user flow. To do this, 
                we created a site map in FigJam that outlined all the screens and how they connect. This visualization
                 helped clarify the app’s functional needs and served as a foundation for building the final Figma
                  prototype.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="flex column body-item">
            <h5>Aesthetic Experimentation</h5>
            <p>Initially, I planned to reuse the design from a previous prototype and focus on development. But 
                after receiving critique, I realized this was a chance to create a visual identity that better fit 
                the app’s purpose.</p>
            <p>The first iteration featured a bold, boxy style I found visually interesting, but it didn’t align with
                 the calm, reflective purpose of the app. </p>

            </picture>
        </div>
        <div class="flex column body-item">
            <p>The next version moved toward a softer, more modern look—one that felt more approachable and emotionally
                 supportive. This process taught me how important it is for design to reflect the emotional context of 
                 a product, especially one centered around personal reflection.</p>
            <p>I also learned the importance of designing with modern devices in mind. Early on, I was designing based 
                on the dimensions of my own phone, which has a much smaller screen than most current devices. As a 
                result, I wasn't accounting for how the app would adapt to larger screens, and many users would have
                 ended up with a very different experience—one I hadn’t intentionally designed. Realizing this pushed
                  me to consider responsive layouts more seriously and ensure the design felt consistent and intentional
                   across devices.</p>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>

            <h5>1. Learning React Native</h5>
            <p>This project came with its fair share of challenges—technical, logistical, and interpersonal. One 
                of the biggest hurdles was working with React Native, the framework we chose so the app could 
                run on both iOS and Android. It seemed like a great opportunity for the team to learn something new,
                 but the learning curve turned out to be steeper than expected. All four developers were brand new
                  to React Native and, despite their enthusiasm, the lack of familiarity significantly slowed down 
                  progress. Eventually, the technical demands outpaced what the team could handle within our timeframe.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Communication & Time Management</h5>
            <p>Another key challenge was team coordination and communication. Since this was one of the first 
                collaborative projects for many team members, we were all navigating how to work together
                 effectively while also learning new tools and technologies. Unfortunately, differences in 
                 experience with project planning and time management led to a mismatch in expectations. While 
                 I had anticipated the complexity and workload involved in a project of this scale, others found 
                 it more difficult to balance alongside their existing commitments. Despite these hurdles, the 
                 experience taught me a lot about adapting in real-time, communicating across disciplines, and 
                 stepping into a leadership role when needed.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>
        
        <div class="flex column body-item">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>

            <p>Although we weren’t able to deliver a working React Native app by the end of the project, this 
                experience became a valuable lesson in leadership, adaptability, and the importance of making 
                the most of your individual strengths. As the only designer on the team—and someone with prior
                 experience in team-based projects—I naturally stepped into a leadership role. I took initiative
                  in organizing meetings, keeping momentum going, and trying to keep the project on track, even 
                  when it became clear that many team members were struggling to keep up due to other commitment
                  s and the technical demands of learning React Native.</p>

            <p>When progress stalled on the development side, I made the conscious decision to pivot the project 
                toward what I could accomplish independently. I put my focus into redesigning the app, iterating
                 on UI and UX decisions, and building a complete interactive prototype in Figma. It wasn’t the
                  outcome I initially envisioned, but it allowed me to bring the core vision of the app to life 
                  and provided a strong foundation for future development—whether I return to it solo or with a 
                  new team. More importantly, it taught me how to respond when things don’t go according to plan:
                   with resilience, creativity, and a deepened trust in my own skills.</p>
