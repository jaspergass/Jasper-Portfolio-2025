            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>Board game enthusiasts often navigate a cluttered landscape of disjointed resources, like forums, 
                databases, and review sites, that can be overwhelming or overly complex. Existing platforms tend to
                 prioritize feature bloat over usability, making it difficult to simply browse, track, and share opinions
                  on games.</p>
            <p>We set out to create a focused, user-friendly alternative: A clean platform that makes it easy to
                 discover games, leave feedback, and organize personal collections—without the noise.</p>
        </div>

            <h4>Data Architecture</h4>

            <p>Before any pixels were pushed, we dedicated two full weeks to planning our database—because for
                 a platform like this, structure is everything.</p>
            <p>We began by identifying key entities: Users, Board Games, Comments, and Collections. From there, 
                we built a detailed ER diagram that mapped out relationships like anonymous commenting, many-to-many
                 connections between games and user collections, and support for future scalability.</p>

            <p>Designing the database early allowed us to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support anonymous and registered interactions seamlessly</li>
                <li>Enable dynamic content rendering across pages (e.g. game detail, user collections)</li>
                <li>Keep performance smooth, even as data grows</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This foundation shaped the entire user experience. With the data structured properly, features 
                like sorting comments by usefulness or filtering games by player count became effortless to 
                implement—both technically and from a UI standpoint.</p>

            <h4>Design</h4>

            <p>Guided by a minimalist philosophy, I designed a clean, modern grid layout accented with a single bold 
                colour. This approach emphasized readability and game imagery, allowing users to quickly scan 
                content without visual clutter.</p>
            <p>Simplicity wasn’t just aesthetic—it was strategic. A streamlined layout made the interface easier
                to adapt responsively across mobile and desktop, and helped us stay on track with development 
                given our tight timeline. The result: a visually focused experience that balanced form, 
                function, and feasibility.</p>

            <h4>Key Features</h4>

            <h5>Search Functionality</h5>
            <p>The site supports robust filtering options, allowing users to search for games using various inputs 
                such as name, category, or average play time. Results are paginated to maintain a clean and navigable
                 layout, minimizing visual clutter and improving performance.</p>

            </picture>

            <h5>Dynamic Game Pages</h5>
            <p>Each game page presents detailed information, including the year of publication and designer.
                 Logged-in users can engage further by leaving comments, submitting ratings, and adding games
                  to personalized collections. Features like comment editing and real-time rating updates are 
                  handled smoothly using AJAX for a seamless user experience.</p>

            </picture>

            <h5>Custom Collections</h5>
            <p>Users can create and manage themed collections, such as “Strategy Favorites” or “Best for Game Night," 
                to organize their favorite board games. This feature adds a layer of personalization and helps users
                 curate content based on their preferences.</p>

            <h5>User Profiles</h5>
            <p>Each profile highlights a user’s recent activity and showcases their custom collections. Basic user
                 stats are also displayed, giving users a quick snapshot of their engagement and contributions to the
                  platform.</p>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>

            <h5>1. Database Design & SQL Optimization</h5>
            <p>Choosing the right database was critical to the success of this project, and we dedicated two weeks 
                to selecting and refining a database structure. The most significant challenge was ensuring the data
                 could be stored efficiently and retrieved quickly. We worked extensively on the ER diagram to store
                  information effectively, reducing redundant data where we could and building with querying in mind.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Implementing AJAX for Smooth User Experience</h5>
            <p>One of the biggest technical challenges was implementing AJAX, which was a new concept for both of us.
                 We wanted users to be able to browse games, leave comments, and submit ratings without full page 
                 reloads. Learning how to send asynchronous requests, update DOM elements dynamically, and debug 
                 JavaScript responses—all while maintaining the integrity of our SQL data—was a steep learning curve.
                  Initially, even small tasks like displaying a new comment without reloading the page were difficult.
                   We had to experiment and iterate often, but once we grasped the basics, we were able to 
                   significantly enhance the user experience by reducing page reloads and making interactions feel 
                   faster and more modern.</p>
            
            <h5>3. Time Management & Streamlining Development</h5>
            <p>Given the limited project timeline, time management was a constant challenge. From designing the 
                database schema to creating the front-end user interface and ensuring all features were implemented 
                and tested, it was crucial to focus on a minimalist approach to avoid feature creep. We kept a clear
                 set of priorities, ensuring the most important features—user accounts, game reviews, and ratings—were
                  functioning properly before we added additional enhancements. This approach allowed us to balance
                   between delivering a polished product and adhering to the project’s time constraints.</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>

            <p>This project was not only a deep dive into web development and database design — it was also a lesson 
                in collaboration, problem-solving, and scoping a project realistically. From selecting and cleaning
                 a dataset to designing an intuitive user experience, every step required intentional decisions and 
                 trade-offs.</p>
            <p>Working as both a designer and developer pushed me to think about how interface choices would impact
                 our codebase, and vice versa. I gained a better understanding of how important early planning is, 
                 especially when it comes to data architecture. The time we invested in building a solid ER diagram
                  and setting up our database structure made later stages much smoother.</p>
            <p>Looking back, I’m proud of how much we were able to accomplish with a small team and tight timeline.
                 There are definitely features I’d love to build on in the future, like game recommendations and 
                 richer filtering, but this version of Playtested achieves exactly what we set out to do: create 
                 a clean, user-first platform for sharing and organizing board games.</p>
